Both share a connection with web development in that they contribute to and utilize the benefits of web development. I started to see how quite possible everything I can fathom can be represented with numbers. Music, light, sound, time, the future, and I'll stop there. This Coming out of college with math degree, I went into education for 11 years. While teaching math and music, and writing online test items to pay the bills, I continued soaking the waves of technology in. The birth of 'screen time', the day everyone has a camera they call a phone with wifi is the world we live, and I am now ready to contribute utilizing technology to help people live better and more fuitrful lives."
